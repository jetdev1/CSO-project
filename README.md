This is a text-based decision tree system made for the KKFSC.

Unfortunately, we were unable to create a drag-and-drop interface to edit the tree. We had to use a text-based system, where we devised system in hopes of creating a user-friendly text-based system. The following is a list explaining some terms used that may not be clear to the first-time user. 

| Term               | Definition                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node               | A "rectangle" in a decision tree                                                              |
| Root node          | The first node in a decision tree                                                             |
| parent node        | The node that points to the current node                                                      |
| parent option      | The option in the parent node that points to the current node                                 |
| Override root node | Shouldn't be needed most of the time. Only used for manually setting the root node if needed. |
